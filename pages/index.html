        Joker Hunt is a card game where players draw cards to score points. Avoid drawing a Joker,
        as it will cost you all your unbanked points! Use picture cards to bank half your points
        safely. Here's how to play:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click "Play" to start the game.</li>
        <li>On your turn, draw up to three cards.</li>
        <li>If you draw a picture card (J, Q, K), you can bank half your points to save them.</li>
        <li>If you draw a Joker, you lose all your unbanked points!</li>
        <li>The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.</li>
      </ol>
