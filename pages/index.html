        Welcome to <strong>Joker Hunt</strong>, the exciting card game where luck and strategy combine! Your goal is to outscore your opponents by collecting points while avoiding the mischievous Jokers. Here's a complete guide on how to play:
      </p>
      <h1>Setup</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Decide the number of players (2 to 4).</li>
        <li>Each player takes turns drawing cards from a shared deck.</li>
        <li>The game ends when the deck runs out of cards.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Gameplay</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start Your Turn:</strong> On your turn, you can draw up to three cards:
          <ul>
            <li>Click on the deck to draw a card.</li>
            <li>You can stop drawing at any time, but you can only draw a maximum of three cards per turn.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Number cards (2â€“10): Add their value to your live score.</li>
            <li>Face cards (J, Q, K): Worth 10 points and allow you to bank half your live score.</li>
            <li>Aces: Worth 11 points.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Joker Effect:</strong> If you draw a Joker:
          <ul>
            <li>You lose all your unbanked (live) points for that turn.</li>
            <li>Your turn ends immediately, and you must shuffle the deck before the next turn.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Banking Points:</strong> You can choose to bank half your live score when you draw a face card (J, Q, K). Banked points are safe and cannot be lost.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn End:</strong> After drawing up to three cards or choosing to bank points, click "End Turn" to pass the turn to the next player. (Turn will automatically end after 3 cards are drawn)</li>
        
      </ol>
      <h1>Winning the Game</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>The game ends when a player reaches 100 points</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Strategies and Tips</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk vs. Reward:</strong> Decide whether to draw more cards or play it safe and bank points early.</li>
        <li><strong>Picture Cards:</strong> Use them strategically to save points when your live score is high.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Jokers:</strong> Be cautious after drawing high-value cards, as a Joker can erase your progress!</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Track:</strong> Pay attention to which cards have already been drawn to improve your decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Good luck and enjoy the thrill of Joker Hunt!</p>
